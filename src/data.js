At the end of 2019, the population of the city's administrative area was estimated at 15,300,000. Once known as Canton, Guangzhou was the only Chinese port accessible to foreign traders between 1760 and 1842 in the Qing Dynasty. It rose to prominence first as a trade port, then as a manufacturing base. More recently, business people by the hundreds of thousands have come for the biannual Canton Fair (China’s largest trade fair), increasingly touring the city sites such as the Canton Tower.",
